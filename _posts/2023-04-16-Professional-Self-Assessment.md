Working through the Computer Science program with Southern New Hampshire has helped me learn more about many different aspects of the digital world. I have learned more about utilizing Git while working in a team through multiple classes using it for team-based classwork. The most recent utilization of Git was GAM-305, where, in a group, we each helped develop a level of a video game, with each of us having different tasks to work on. The class also helped me develop communication skills that were originally introduced earlier in the degree. Using agile, which was introduced earlier but was able to be used in practice during the team classes, helped me discuss issues and potential resolutions earlier while they occurred and allowed them to be fixed before other issues happened.  

Data structures and algorithms were addressed in multiple different ways, with some classes teaching ways of sorting data and pulling the data that was needed. Other classes, like CS-260 helped me learn hashing and other forms of string matching. 

Other classes helped me understand the role of data and how it can be interacted with using different tools. Database usage happened in a few different classes, with one teaching how to create and manage a database and others teaching how to search for trends and other useful information utilizing the data within. Searching for trends and potential causations was a very interesting task for me to complete, and I wish to pursue it further in the future. 

The classes used to teach database management also helped with security as information in a database should be treated as confidential information. Providing adequate login information and ensuring that the access points are secure are very important items to consider as any vulnerability could be exploited to gain access to that confidential information. Managing user’s permissions is also important as you do not want someone who shouldn’t have access to certain tasks to be able to accomplish those tasks. That can be handled by ensuring the user can only read data if that is all they need access to. 

The artifact provided helps to show my understanding of the Python language and how it functions. Most classes are short and consist of only the task they were named after. This allows the code to be readable, and others could pick up the code and easily make changes should they wish to. With the transition of the code from Java to Python, the efficiency of the code was improved as Python does include its own Math library, allowing for some tasks to be improved upon. The database section was a challenge to include, however, one is used for the history of the equations that users run. It can create entries, read entries, and delete everything on the table should the user request it. The only thing it cannot do is update previous entries, but that is there as math is stable and changing an equation would cause the wrong equations to be shown.
